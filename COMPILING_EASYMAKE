To compile easymake, you must do so manually using either tcc, gcc, clang or MSVC.
Here are instructions for compiling with either of those three compilers:

tcc:
  tcc src/easymake.c -Iinclude -O3 -o easymake

gcc:
  gcc src/easymake.c -Iinclude -s -O3 -o easymake

clang:
  clang src/easymake.c -Iinclude -O3 -o easymake

MSVC:
  cl src/easymake.c /I include /O2
